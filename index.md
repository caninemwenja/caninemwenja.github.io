Hi, I'm Kennedy Mwenja aka Canine. 

I'm a Software Engineer at [Savannah Informatics Limited](http://savannahinformatics.com/). I studied CS at [UON](http://uonbi.ac.ke).

Check out projects that I've done at [Github](http://github.com/caninemwenja) and [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/caninemwenja) though most of current work is proprietary (read organization owned).
You can check out my open source report card at [OSRC](https://osrc.dfm.io/caninemwenja/) but don't take it too seriously :D.

These days I code mostly in Python and Javascript, though I used to do a lot of Java and PHP projects. I also do a lot of DevOps on Linux systems with tools such as Salt, Ansible and Docker.

Find me at [Twitter](http://twitter.com/caninemwenja) or [G+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/105694703143927243193/posts).
You can also contact me directly at mwenja07[at]gmail[dot]com.
